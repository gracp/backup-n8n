From that point on:\n\nA main trigger (manual or scheduled) kicks off the process.\n\nn8n fetches the theme and triggers several sub-workflows, including:\n\n✅ WhatsApp content generation (multiple message models)\n✅ Email creation with text + image (using ChatGPT + DALL·E/OpenAI Image API)\n✅ Blog posts with automatic SEO and publishing to WordPress\n✅ Trello card creation with links to all generated documents\n✅ All outputs go through formatting in Google Docs, Gmail integration, and automatic storage\n\n🧠 The architecture is structured by content type:\n\nWhatsApp (emotional and sales-oriented messages)\n\nEmail marketing (two versions with visuals and CTAs)\n\nBlog (fully structured with SEO)\n\nLinkedIn (adapted for technical or institutional tone)\n\nPitch/VSL (long-form persuasive format)\n\n🧩 All nodes are designed to receive the same theme input and return the result to the central workflow. A Merge node syncs the outputs before the flow finishes and frees up the theme for the next cycle.\n\n📣 If anyone has questions, suggestions, or wants to review the logic, I’m open to feedback and improvements!\n\n#n8n #workflow #automation #opensource #chatgpt #marketingautomation #trello #gmail #googleapps",

From that point on:&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;A main trigger (manual or scheduled) kicks off the process.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;n8n fetches the theme and triggers several sub-workflows, including:&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;✅ WhatsApp content generation (multiple message models)\n✅ Email creation with text + image (using ChatGPT + DALL·E/OpenAI Image API)\n✅ Blog posts with automatic SEO and publishing to WordPress\n✅ Trello card creation with links to all generated documents\n✅ All outputs go through formatting in Google Docs, Gmail integration, and automatic storage&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;🧠 The architecture is structured by content type:&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;WhatsApp (emotional and sales-oriented messages)&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Email marketing (two versions with visuals and CTAs)&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Blog (fully structured with SEO)&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;LinkedIn (adapted for technical or institutional tone)&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Pitch/VSL (long-form persuasive format)&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;🧩 All nodes are designed to receive the same theme input and return the result to the central workflow. A Merge node syncs the outputs before the flow finishes and frees up the theme for the next cycle.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;📣 If anyone has questions, suggestions, or wants to review the logic, I’m open to feedback and improvements!&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;h1&gt;n8n #workflow #automation #opensource #chatgpt #marketingautomation #trello #gmail #googleapps&lt;/h1&gt;\n&lt;/div&gt;&lt;!-- SC_ON --&gt;",

          "selftext": "Now before I get started, I know this automation may be a bit controversial as there's a lot of spam already on Twitter, but I truly believe it is possible to build a Twitter / X reply bot that is useful to people if you get your messaging down and do a good job of filtering out irrelevant messages that don't make much sense to reply to.\n\nI currently run an AI Tools directory and we noticed that each day, there are a bunch of Tweets that get posted that ask for advice on choosing the best AI Tool for a specific task or job such as \"What is the best AI Tool for writing blog posts?\" or \"What is the best AI Tool for clipping short form videos?\"\n\nTweets like this are perfect opportunity for us to jump in, and share a link to a category page or list of tools on our directory to help them find and explore exactly what they are looking for. The problem with this is it just would take forever to do this manually as I'd have to be in front of the screen all day watching Twitter instead of doing 'real work'.\n\nSo, we decided to build an AI automation that completely automates this. At a high level, we use Mention.com to monitor and alert for AI Tool questions getting asked on twitter -&gt; use a prompt to evaluate each of these tweets individually to see if it is a good and relevant question -&gt; fetch a list of category pages from our own website -&gt; write a helpful reply that mentions we have a page specifically for the type of tools they are looking for.\n\nEach reply we share here doesn't amount to a ton of impressions or traffic, but ultimately this is something we believe will compound over time as it lets us have this marketing motion turned on that wasn't feasible before.\n\n## Here's a full breakdown of the automation\n\n### 1. Trigger / Inputs\n\nThe entry point into this whole automation starts with [Mention.com](http://Mention.com), we setup a new keyword alert that monitors for phrases like \"Is there any AI Tool\" or \"How can I use AI to\", etc.\n\nThis setup is really important as you need to filter out a bunch of the noise that doesn't make sense to reply to. It is also important that your alert that you have setup is going to be your target customer or persona you are trying to get in front of.\n\nAfter the alert is configured, we used the [Mention.com](http://Mention.com) &lt;&gt; Slack integration to post the feed of all alerts into a dedicated slack channel setup just for this.\n\n### 2. Initial Filtering &amp; Validation\n\nThe next couple of nodes are responsible for further filtering out ineligible Tweets that we don't want to respond too. This includes checking if the Tweet from the alert is a Retweet or if the Tweet from the alert actually was from the account we want to with (avoid our own reply causing an infinite execution loop)\n\n### 3. Evaluation Prompt + LLM Call\n\nThe first LLM call we make here is a simple prompt that checks the text content of the Tweet from the alert and makes a decision if we want to proceed with creating a reply or if we should exit early out of the workflow.\n\nIf you are taking this workflow and extending it for your own use-case, it will be important that you change this for your own goals. In this prompt, I found it most effective to include examples of Tweets that we did want to reply to and Tweets that we wanted to skip over.\n\n### 4. Build Context for Tweet Reply\n\nThis step is also going to be very specific to your own goals and how you want to modify this workflow.\n\n* In our case, we are making an HTTP request to our own API in order to get back a JSON list of all category pages on our website.\n* We then take that JSON and format it nicely into more LLM-friendly text\n* We finally take that text and will include it in our next prompt to actually write the Tweet reply\n\nIf you are going to use this workflow / automation, this step must be changed and customized for the kind of reply you are trying to create. If you are trying to share helpful resources with potential leads and customers, it would be a good idea to retrieve and build up that context at this step.\n\n### 5. Write The Tweet Reply\n\nIn this step we take all of the context created from before and use Claude to write a Tweet reply. For our reply, we like to keep it short + include a link to one of the category pages on the AI Tools website.\n\nSince our goal is to share these pages with people asking for AI Tool suggestions, we found it most effective to include Tweet input + good examples of a reply Tweet that we would personally write if we were doing this manually.\n\n### 6. Posting The Reply + Notifying In Slack\n\nThe final step here was actually using the X / Twiter node in n8n to post the reply to the original Tweet we got an alert for. All that is needed here is to pass in the initial Tweet Id we need to reply to and the output of our LLM call to claude which wrote the Tweet.\n\nAfter that, we have a couple of Slack nodes hooked up that leave a checkmark reaction and will share the Tweet output that claude decided to go with so we can easily monitor and make changes to the prompt if we found that the reply was not quite what we were looking for.\n\nMost of the work here comes from iterating on the prompt so its important to have a good feedback loop in place so you can see what is happening as the automation runs over more and more Tweets.\n\n## Workflow Link + Other Resources\n\n* Github workflow link: https://github.com/lucaswalter/n8n-workflows/blob/main/twitter_reply_guy_agent.json\n* YouTube video that walks through this workflow step-by-step: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Q_b5uPndsLY\n\nAlso wanted to share that my team and I run a free Skool community called [AI Automation Mastery](https://www.skool.com/ai-automation-mastery-group) where we build and share the automations we are working on. Would love to have you as a part of it if you are interested!",

          "selftext_html": "&lt;!-- SC_OFF --&gt;&lt;div class=\"md\"&gt;&lt;p&gt;Now before I get started, I know this automation may be a bit controversial as there&amp;#39;s a lot of spam already on Twitter, but I truly believe it is possible to build a Twitter / X reply bot that is useful to people if you get your messaging down and do a good job of filtering out irrelevant messages that don&amp;#39;t make much sense to reply to.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;I currently run an AI Tools directory and we noticed that each day, there are a bunch of Tweets that get posted that ask for advice on choosing the best AI Tool for a specific task or job such as &amp;quot;What is the best AI Tool for writing blog posts?&amp;quot; or &amp;quot;What is the best AI Tool for clipping short form videos?&amp;quot;&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Tweets like this are perfect opportunity for us to jump in, and share a link to a category page or list of tools on our directory to help them find and explore exactly what they are looking for. The problem with this is it just would take forever to do this manually as I&amp;#39;d have to be in front of the screen all day watching Twitter instead of doing &amp;#39;real work&amp;#39;.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;So, we decided to build an AI automation that completely automates this. At a high level, we use Mention.com to monitor and alert for AI Tool questions getting asked on twitter -&amp;gt; use a prompt to evaluate each of these tweets individually to see if it is a good and relevant question -&amp;gt; fetch a list of category pages from our own website -&amp;gt; write a helpful reply that mentions we have a page specifically for the type of tools they are looking for.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Each reply we share here doesn&amp;#39;t amount to a ton of impressions or traffic, but ultimately this is something we believe will compound over time as it lets us have this marketing motion turned on that wasn&amp;#39;t feasible before.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;h2&gt;Here&amp;#39;s a full breakdown of the automation&lt;/h2&gt;\n\n&lt;h3&gt;1. Trigger / Inputs&lt;/h3&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;The entry point into this whole automation starts with &lt;a href=\"http://Mention.com\"&gt;Mention.com&lt;/a&gt;, we setup a new keyword alert that monitors for phrases like &amp;quot;Is there any AI Tool&amp;quot; or &amp;quot;How can I use AI to&amp;quot;, etc.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;This setup is really important as you need to filter out a bunch of the noise that doesn&amp;#39;t make sense to reply to. It is also important that your alert that you have setup is going to be your target customer or persona you are trying to get in front of.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;After the alert is configured, we used the &lt;a href=\"http://Mention.com\"&gt;Mention.com&lt;/a&gt; &amp;lt;&amp;gt; Slack integration to post the feed of all alerts into a dedicated slack channel setup just for this.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;h3&gt;2. Initial Filtering &amp;amp; Validation&lt;/h3&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;The next couple of nodes are responsible for further filtering out ineligible Tweets that we don&amp;#39;t want to respond too. This includes checking if the Tweet from the alert is a Retweet or if the Tweet from the alert actually was from the account we want to with (avoid our own reply causing an infinite execution loop)&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;h3&gt;3. Evaluation Prompt + LLM Call&lt;/h3&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;The first LLM call we make here is a simple prompt that checks the text content of the Tweet from the alert and makes a decision if we want to proceed with creating a reply or if we should exit early out of the workflow.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;If you are taking this workflow and extending it for your own use-case, it will be important that you change this for your own goals. In this prompt, I found it most effective to include examples of Tweets that we did want to reply to and Tweets that we wanted to skip over.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;h3&gt;4. Build Context for Tweet Reply&lt;/h3&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;This step is also going to be very specific to your own goals and how you want to modify this workflow.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;ul&gt;\n&lt;li&gt;In our case, we are making an HTTP request to our own API in order to get back a JSON list of all category pages on our website.&lt;/li&gt;\n&lt;li&gt;We then take that JSON and format it nicely into more LLM-friendly text&lt;/li&gt;\n&lt;li&gt;We finally take that text and will include it in our next prompt to actually write the Tweet reply&lt;/li&gt;\n&lt;/ul&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;If you are going to use this workflow / automation, this step must be changed and customized for the kind of reply you are trying to create. If you are trying to share helpful resources with potential leads and customers, it would be a good idea to retrieve and build up that context at this step.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;h3&gt;5. Write The Tweet Reply&lt;/h3&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;In this step we take all of the context created from before and use Claude to write a Tweet reply. For our reply, we like to keep it short + include a link to one of the category pages on the AI Tools website.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Since our goal is to share these pages with people asking for AI Tool suggestions, we found it most effective to include Tweet input + good examples of a reply Tweet that we would personally write if we were doing this manually.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;h3&gt;6. Posting The Reply + Notifying In Slack&lt;/h3&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;The final step here was actually using the X / Twiter node in n8n to post the reply to the original Tweet we got an alert for. All that is needed here is to pass in the initial Tweet Id we need to reply to and the output of our LLM call to claude which wrote the Tweet.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;After that, we have a couple of Slack nodes hooked up that leave a checkmark reaction and will share the Tweet output that claude decided to go with so we can easily monitor and make changes to the prompt if we found that the reply was not quite what we were looking for.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Most of the work here comes from iterating on the prompt so its important to have a good feedback loop in place so you can see what is happening as the automation runs over more and more Tweets.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;h2&gt;Workflow Link + Other Resources&lt;/h2&gt;\n\n&lt;ul&gt;\n&lt;li&gt;Github workflow link: &lt;a href=\"https://github.com/lucaswalter/n8n-workflows/blob/main/twitter_reply_guy_agent.json\"&gt;https://github.com/lucaswalter/n8n-workflows/blob/main/twitter_reply_guy_agent.json&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/li&gt;\n&lt;li&gt;YouTube video that walks through this workflow step-by-step: &lt;a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Q_b5uPndsLY\"&gt;https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Q_b5uPndsLY&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/li&gt;\n&lt;/ul&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Also wanted to share that my team and I run a free Skool community called &lt;a href=\"https://www.skool.com/ai-automation-mastery-group\"&gt;AI Automation Mastery&lt;/a&gt; where we build and share the automations we are working on. Would love to have you as a part of it if you are interested!&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;/div&gt;&lt;!-- SC_ON --&gt;",

I've spent about 70- 80 hours on my new one, with building the workflows and supporting applications, recording and editing, maybe even more - it's really taken it out of me! I don't think I'll do one like this again! It is a real-world use case, and we use it internally in my business.\n\nIn the video, I walk through an Azure app registration, walk through a template that gets meeting transcription from Microsoft Teams/Graph and processes them with AI, and displays the output in an n8n hosted interactive web app with running javascript, then I take it to another level by showing how to make a single workflow multi-user. You will learn a lot from the video, so I suggest you check it out, study it, and take it all in!\n\nFrom a business perspective, it's valuable as it allows for AI analysis of meetings without needing to send data to 3rd parties, given you could use an Azure AI model, keeping compliance in mind, and self-hosted n8n.\n\nCheck it out here [https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=83NPEh62Zyc](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=83NPEh62Zyc)\n\nThe video has a supporting blog post with full instructions (meeting the Reddit posting guidelines) [Automate Microsoft Teams Meeting Analysis with GPT-4.1, Outlook &amp; Mem.ai](https://blog.nocodecreative.io/automate-teams-transcript-to-summary-n8n/)\n\nHit me up with any questions, and feel free to connect with me on LinkedIn [(1) Wayne Simpson | LinkedIn](https://www.linkedin.com/in/simpsonwayne/)\n\nWayne",

Manual everything. No security. No scalability.\n\nStack: Python + Flask, with a sprinkle of shell scripts. No workflow engine, no cloud automation, no containers.\n\n\nThe Pain Points\n\nUsers wanted dynamic templates (not just one doc).\n\nThey wanted to upload IDs, have the data extracted automatically, and generate professional legal docs (Word, PDF) for signing/editing.\n\nEverything needed to be secure (GDPR/legal), reliable, and scalable for many small law offices, each with their own data/privacy needs.\n\n\n\n---\n\nWhat I Built (with n8n as the Heartbeat)\n\nDynamic template system: Users pick any doc template; the system auto-extracts required fields and matches user uploads to fill them.\n\nAdvanced OCR flow: PaddleOCR (self-hosted, fast, customizable), fallback to OCR.space; AI prompt parsing to extract data reliably—even from messy images.\n\nMulti-layer debug: Every step in the workflow writes human-readable debug info (mem.debug.ocr.*) for both developer troubleshooting and user feedback (“why did my image fail?”).\n\nSession isolation: Each client gets their own containerized stack—OpenWebUI, n8n, Nextcloud (for docs), Collabora (for editing)—with strict privacy and zero data leakage.\n\nSingle Sign-On (SSO): goauthentik in front of everything (OpenWebUI, Nextcloud, etc.) so each client only sees their own environment. Full audit trail, group routing, etc.\n\nFully automated deployment: With Docker Compose + Portainer, new clients get their own “mini SaaS” in minutes. I can push, update, or roll back workflows via JSON injection (CI/CD for n8n).\n\nEasy scaling: All heavy-lift services (PaddleOCR, dev tools, Ollama, GPT, etc.) are on shared containers—clients only interact with their own UI &amp; data.\n\n\n\n---\n\nWhat I Learned\n\nIterate relentlessly: Don’t over-architect at the start, but always leave room for abstraction/modularity. My first workflow was spaghetti; now it’s all reusable.\n\nDebug everything: Build in transparent logging/debugging (for me and for users!). mem.debug.ocr has saved me countless hours and improved user trust.\n\nContainerize for sanity: Per-client containers = zero cross-client issues, easy GDPR compliance, and “app store” flexibility (add new services per client).\n\nAutomate deployment: CI/CD for n8n workflows (JSON push), easy rollback, and “beta rollout” to specific clients.\n\nSSO is a gamechanger: Don’t trust any UI/service with built-in login for real privacy—use an SSO layer (goauthentik) and keep secrets out of your app logic.\n\n\n\n---\n\nStill Improving\n\nPolishing OCR: Prompt engineering + PaddleOCR is getting me ~9.3/10 accuracy, but I want even more.\n\nClient self-service: Next step is to let clients manage some of their workflows/automation themselves (within guardrails).\n\nFuture features: More AI (local Ollama), deeper legal doc integrations, and maybe a template marketplace.\n\n\n\n---\n\nIf anyone’s thinking about automating legal (or any process-heavy) workflows with n8n, AI, and containers, I’m happy to answer questions.\nIf you’re working on something similar, let’s connect!\n\n\n",

          "postcontent": "In this post, we’ll walk through how to solve the \"send message and wait for response\" issue with the Telegram trigger in n8n. The problem arises when using this option to send a message to a user and wait for their response. By default, n8n’s Telegram node generates a button that, when clicked, opens a web page with an input field and a save button to trigger the n8n Telegram webhook.\n\nWhile this works perfectly, it’s not always what we want. Many of us prefer a simpler system where we send a text message and wait for a direct text response, but n8n doesn’t support this natively. So, we need a workaround to make it happen.The workaround is straightforward. First, we send the question or prompt to the user and store a context in our database. To do this, we create a new table called \"Context,\" which is linked to the user’s ChatID. This context is updated every time we send a text and expect a response. \n\nWhen the user sends a new message, we check the context in our database before processing the message in our router. We compare the user’s text with the expected response. For example, if the user’s message matches a predefined response (like \"I call back\"), we handle it accordingly. \n\nOtherwise, we refer to the last context stored in the database to process the text.I hope I’ve explained this idea as simply as possible. I’ve attached a picture to give you a clearer idea of how it works.\n\nDisclaimer: This post was improved by AI to correct any orthographic mistakes.",

          "title": "I built an AI workflow that monitors Twitter (X) for relevant keywords and posts a reply to promote my business (Mention.com + X API)",
          "postcontent": "Now before I get started, I know this automation may be a bit controversial as there's a lot of spam already on Twitter, but I truly believe it is possible to build a Twitter / X reply bot that is useful to people if you get your messaging down and do a good job of filtering out irrelevant messages that don't make much sense to reply to.\n\nI currently run an AI Tools directory and we noticed that each day, there are a bunch of Tweets that get posted that ask for advice on choosing the best AI Tool for a specific task or job such as \"What is the best AI Tool for writing blog posts?\" or \"What is the best AI Tool for clipping short form videos?\"\n\nTweets like this are perfect opportunity for us to jump in, and share a link to a category page or list of tools on our directory to help them find and explore exactly what they are looking for. The problem with this is it just would take forever to do this manually as I'd have to be in front of the screen all day watching Twitter instead of doing 'real work'.\n\nSo, we decided to build an AI automation that completely automates this. At a high level, we use Mention.com to monitor and alert for AI Tool questions getting asked on twitter -&gt; use a prompt to evaluate each of these tweets individually to see if it is a good and relevant question -&gt; fetch a list of category pages from our own website -&gt; write a helpful reply that mentions we have a page specifically for the type of tools they are looking for.\n\nEach reply we share here doesn't amount to a ton of impressions or traffic, but ultimately this is something we believe will compound over time as it lets us have this marketing motion turned on that wasn't feasible before.\n\n## Here's a full breakdown of the automation\n\n### 1. Trigger / Inputs\n\nThe entry point into this whole automation starts with [Mention.com](http://Mention.com), we setup a new keyword alert that monitors for phrases like \"Is there any AI Tool\" or \"How can I use AI to\", etc.\n\nThis setup is really important as you need to filter out a bunch of the noise that doesn't make sense to reply to. It is also important that your alert that you have setup is going to be your target customer or persona you are trying to get in front of.\n\nAfter the alert is configured, we used the [Mention.com](http://Mention.com) &lt;&gt; Slack integration to post the feed of all alerts into a dedicated slack channel setup just for this.\n\n### 2. Initial Filtering &amp; Validation\n\nThe next couple of nodes are responsible for further filtering out ineligible Tweets that we don't want to respond too. This includes checking if the Tweet from the alert is a Retweet or if the Tweet from the alert actually was from the account we want to with (avoid our own reply causing an infinite execution loop)\n\n### 3. Evaluation Prompt + LLM Call\n\nThe first LLM call we make here is a simple prompt that checks the text content of the Tweet from the alert and makes a decision if we want to proceed with creating a reply or if we should exit early out of the workflow.\n\nIf you are taking this workflow and extending it for your own use-case, it will be important that you change this for your own goals. In this prompt, I found it most effective to include examples of Tweets that we did want to reply to and Tweets that we wanted to skip over.\n\n### 4. Build Context for Tweet Reply\n\nThis step is also going to be very specific to your own goals and how you want to modify this workflow.\n\n* In our case, we are making an HTTP request to our own API in order to get back a JSON list of all category pages on our website.\n* We then take that JSON and format it nicely into more LLM-friendly text\n* We finally take that text and will include it in our next prompt to actually write the Tweet reply\n\nIf you are going to use this workflow / automation, this step must be changed and customized for the kind of reply you are trying to create. If you are trying to share helpful resources with potential leads and customers, it would be a good idea to retrieve and build up that context at this step.\n\n### 5. Write The Tweet Reply\n\nIn this step we take all of the context created from before and use Claude to write a Tweet reply. For our reply, we like to keep it short + include a link to one of the category pages on the AI Tools website.\n\nSince our goal is to share these pages with people asking for AI Tool suggestions, we found it most effective to include Tweet input + good examples of a reply Tweet that we would personally write if we were doing this manually.\n\n### 6. Posting The Reply + Notifying In Slack\n\nThe final step here was actually using the X / Twiter node in n8n to post the reply to the original Tweet we got an alert for. All that is needed here is to pass in the initial Tweet Id we need to reply to and the output of our LLM call to claude which wrote the Tweet.\n\nAfter that, we have a couple of Slack nodes hooked up that leave a checkmark reaction and will share the Tweet output that claude decided to go with so we can easily monitor and make changes to the prompt if we found that the reply was not quite what we were looking for.\n\nMost of the work here comes from iterating on the prompt so its important to have a good feedback loop in place so you can see what is happening as the automation runs over more and more Tweets.\n\n## Workflow Link + Other Resources\n\n* Github workflow link: https://github.com/lucaswalter/n8n-workflows/blob/main/twitter_reply_guy_agent.json\n* YouTube video that walks through this workflow step-by-step: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Q_b5uPndsLY\n\nAlso wanted to share that my team and I run a free Skool community called [AI Automation Mastery](https://www.skool.com/ai-automation-mastery-group) where we build and share the automations we are working on. Would love to have you as a part of it if you are interested!",

          "postcontent": "\nHey all,\n\nJust wanted to share a pretty wild journey over the last 2 months, which took me from knowing almost nothing about n8n, OpenWebUI, or the intricacies of SaaS infrastructure—to building a production-ready legal AI agent that’s already live for paying clients.\n\nThe Starting Point\n\nMVP: A basic script that filled ONE legal doc with five hardcoded fields. Manual everything. No security. No scalability.\n\nStack: Python + Flask, with a sprinkle of shell scripts. No workflow engine, no cloud automation, no containers.\n\n\nThe Pain Points\n\nUsers wanted dynamic templates (not just one doc).\n\nThey wanted to upload IDs, have the data extracted automatically, and generate professional legal docs (Word, PDF) for signing/editing.\n\nEverything needed to be secure (GDPR/legal), reliable, and scalable for many small law offices, each with their own data/privacy needs.\n\n\n\n---\n\nWhat I Built (with n8n as the Heartbeat)\n\nDynamic template system: Users pick any doc template; the system auto-extracts required fields and matches user uploads to fill them.\n\nAdvanced OCR flow: PaddleOCR (self-hosted, fast, customizable), fallback to OCR.space; AI prompt parsing to extract data reliably—even from messy images.\n\nMulti-layer debug: Every step in the workflow writes human-readable debug info (mem.debug.ocr.*) for both developer troubleshooting and user feedback (“why did my image fail?”).\n\nSession isolation: Each client gets their own containerized stack—OpenWebUI, n8n, Nextcloud (for docs), Collabora (for editing)—with strict privacy and zero data leakage.\n\nSingle Sign-On (SSO): goauthentik in front of everything (OpenWebUI, Nextcloud, etc.) so each client only sees their own environment. Full audit trail, group routing, etc.\n\nFully automated deployment: With Docker Compose + Portainer, new clients get their own “mini SaaS” in minutes. I can push, update, or roll back workflows via JSON injection (CI/CD for n8n).\n\nEasy scaling: All heavy-lift services (PaddleOCR, dev tools, Ollama, GPT, etc.) are on shared containers—clients only interact with their own UI &amp; data.\n\n\n\n---\n\nWhat I Learned\n\nIterate relentlessly: Don’t over-architect at the start, but always leave room for abstraction/modularity. My first workflow was spaghetti; now it’s all reusable.\n\nDebug everything: Build in transparent logging/debugging (for me and for users!). mem.debug.ocr has saved me countless hours and improved user trust.\n\nContainerize for sanity: Per-client containers = zero cross-client issues, easy GDPR compliance, and “app store” flexibility (add new services per client).\n\nAutomate deployment: CI/CD for n8n workflows (JSON push), easy rollback, and “beta rollout” to specific clients.\n\nSSO is a gamechanger: Don’t trust any UI/service with built-in login for real privacy—use an SSO layer (goauthentik) and keep secrets out of your app logic.\n\n\n\n---\n\nStill Improving\n\nPolishing OCR: Prompt engineering + PaddleOCR is getting me ~9.3/10 accuracy, but I want even more.\n\nClient self-service: Next step is to let clients manage some of their workflows/automation themselves (within guardrails).\n\nFuture features: More AI (local Ollama), deeper legal doc integrations, and maybe a template marketplace.\n\n\n\n---\n\nIf anyone’s thinking about automating legal (or any process-heavy) workflows with n8n, AI, and containers, I’m happy to answer questions.\nIf you’re working on something similar, let’s connect!\n\n\n",

They discovered that prospects were skeptical and found the automation concept confusing. Providing a visual mock-up of the end result (a SaaS dashboard) significantly improved engagement and led to a sales call. Now, the author is debating whether to consistently include mock-ups in all outreach and client deliveries, despite the added effort, as a way to increase closing rates and command higher prices.\n\n**Business Problem:**\n\nLow conversion rates in cold outreach when selling n8n-based custom SaaS dashboards, due to a lack of understanding and trust from potential clients regarding the automation aspect.\n",

          "postcontent": "I'm not getting the conversion rates from cold outreach that I expected. But I got some valuable feedback from one rejection that actually didn't ghost me.\n\nShe told me the automation stuff seemed new and scammy to her, she just didn't get it. But then I sent her a picture of a SaaS template showing lead closings, charts, etc., and she immediately connected with that. Having a visual helped her understand that I'd be writing code to create a dashboard. She didn't really care what I was doing in the backend anymore, it just didn't sound as mysterious, and she could see from the visual what the automation would actually help her with.\n\nThat single extra effort turned the convo around and we're actually having a sales call now.\n\nSo I'm wondering if this is something I should be doing with every outreach, spending the effort to give them at least a mock of the end result. But of course I don't want to spend extra effort for each outreach AND for each client delivery. Yeah, I could use Cursor or a template for the UI when I deliver, but the tools aren't perfect yet, and I'd still have to adapt it to the n8n workflow.\n\nIt feels like I'm crossing more into being a custom software dev on demand rather than an automation business. Though I guess if you put in the extra effort, you could also differentiate and sell for more.\n\nSo two questions**:**\n\n1. Have you found it useful to deliver with custom FE/app for better closing rates and higher ticket amounts?\n2. If so, what tools/methods do you use for that?",
